> United States Swimming has matured as an organization and
expanded services to individuals and clubs.  To support this
expansion, USS has developed a computer plan. One component is a
standard interchange format for technical data.  Swimming data
must be transmitted among the clubs, Local Swimming Committees
(LSCs), and the USS headquarters office.  Exchanging meet results
is one example, where data from a host club is distributed to
swimmers and clubs using diskettes or modems.  Some LSCs are
compiling swimmer statistics and would retype the data from
printed sheets if electronic transmission were not available.
A standard format promotes easy exchange of data and the
development of new computer programs and services.  The goal is
to preserve the valuable efforts of our volunteers.
